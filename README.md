**GamepadCore** is a high-performance, platform-agnostic C++ library designed to handle raw HID communication with game controllers. It bypasses generic abstraction layers (like XInput or SDL) to unlock hardware-specific features often inaccessible in standard APIs.

> 🚀 **Battle-Tested & Engine Agnostic:**
> While currently powering the [Godot-Dualsense](https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/Godot-Dualsense) GDExtension, this core logic is built to be easily integrated into **Unreal Engine**, **Unity** (via Native Plugin), custom engines, or standalone C++ applications.

## 🔌 Integrations & Showcase

Since **GamepadCore** is decoupled from game engines, it serves as the backend logic for multiple implementations. See it in action:

| Engine | Project                                                                                                | Description |

> 💡 **Why this matters:** This proves that the core logic (HID parsing, Haptics, Trigger math) is written once and reused everywhere.

## ✨ Key Features
This library implements the raw protocol logic to communicate directly with hardware, offering features that standard drivers miss:

* 🏗️ Extensible Multi-Platform Architecture: Flexible design using policy-based templates. Supporting new hardware or platforms is as simple as implementing a connection interface.

* 🔌 Dynamic Hot-Swap: Automatically detects controller connection and disconnection events in real-time without stalling the main loop.

* 🎯 Adaptive Triggers: Full native control over resistance, vibration, and "weapon recoil" effects on DualSense L2/R2 triggers.

* 💡 Lightbar & LED Control: Direct programmatic access to RGB Lightbar, Player LEDs, and Microphone Mute LED.

* ⚡ Optimized Performance: Zero-allocation loop architecture designed for high-performance scenarios, ideal for multiplayer environments where latency matters.

* ⚙️ Force Feedback: Low-level command generation for standard rumble motors (High/Low frequency).

* 🤝 Non-Intrusive: Designed to coexist with existing input managers (like Windows RawInput, UE Enhanced Input, or SDL), preventing device conflict.
## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

The library follows a strict separation of concerns to ensure portability. By using **Policy-Based Design**, the core logic remains pure C++, while platform-specific details (like how Windows handles USB vs. how Linux handles HID) are injected externally.

### 1. GCore (Abstract Layer)
The stable heart of the library. It defines generic interfaces (`IGamepad`, `IGamepadTrigger`) and the Device Registry logic. It knows **nothing** about the specific OS or Engine, ensuring the code is completely portable.

### 2. Platform Policy (The Bridge)
This is where the flexibility lies. You provide a "Policy" class that tells the Core *how* to identify and communicate with devices on your specific environment.
* **Example:** `WindowsHardwarePolicy` uses `setupapi.h`, while a custom `GodotRegistryPolicy` hooks into Godot's internal callbacks.

### 3. Implementations (The Drivers)
Contains the specific HID protocol logic (byte arrays) for the hardware itself.
* **SonyGamepadAbstract:** Handles logic shared between PS4/PS5.
* **DualSenseLibrary:** Handles specific DualSense features (Adaptive Triggers, Haptics, Lightbar) by interpreting raw input/output reports.

## 💻 Integration Example
1. Basic Setup (C++ Standalone)
   To use GamepadCore in your project, you instantiate the registry with a specific policy.
2. Continuous Device Discovery (Game Loop)
   The registry periodically scans for new devices and updates their connection states.
   #include "GCore/Templates/TBasicDeviceRegistry.h"
   #include "Platforms/Windows/WindowsHardwarePolicy.h"
```cpp
// Define a registry using the Windows Policy
using MyDeviceRegistry = GamepadCore::TBasicDeviceRegistry<WindowsHardwarePolicy>;

int main() {
auto registry = std::make_unique<MyDeviceRegistry>();

    // Main Loop
    while (true) {
        // 1. Detect devices
        registry->PlugAndPlay(0.016f); // DeltaTime
        
        // 2. Access a connected gamepad
        auto* gamepad = registry->GetLibrary(0); // ID 0
        
        if (gamepad) {
            // Send specific HID command (e.g., Set Lightbar to Red)
            gamepad->SetLightbarColor(255, 0, 0); 
            
            // Trigger Effect: Resistance
            gamepad->GetIGamepadTrigger()->SetTriggerEffect(
                TriggerId::Right, 
                TriggerMode::Resistance, 
                0, 255
            );
        }
    }
}
```

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing (Build & sanity checks)

GamepadCore is meant to be consumed **from source** (e.g., compiled inside an engine/plugin build).  
This repository still provides a CMake project so contributors can quickly validate changes locally.

### Requirements
- CMake >= 3.20
- C++20 compiler (Clang/GCC/MSVC)
- Ninja (recommended) or Make

### 1) Configure (one time per build type)

```bash
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

### 2) Format (before pushing)
```bash
cmake --build cmake-build-debug --target GamepadCoreFormat -j
```
### 3) Compile (after any change)

```bash
cmake --build cmake-build-debug --target GamepadCore -j
cmake --build cmake-build-release --target GamepadCore -j
````

### Notes
- Build artifacts (like `libGamepadCore.a`) are generated inside the build folder (e.g. `cmake-build-release/Source/`).
- Contributors generally should **not** commit build directories (`cmake-build-*`).
