**GamepadCore** is a modern, **policy-based C++ library** designed to provide unified access to advanced gamepad features (DualSense, DualShock 4) across multiple platforms and game engines.

It decouples **Hardware Logic** from **Engine Logic**, allowing you to write your input code once and run it anywhere.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **⚡ Engine Agnostic:** Zero dependencies on specific game engines in the Core logic.
* **🧩 Policy-Based Design:**
    * **Registry Policy:** Adapt container types (e.g., `TMap`, `std::map`) and ID types (e.g., `FInputDeviceId`, `int`) to fit your engine's ecosystem.
    * **Hardware Policy:** Inject platform-specific drivers (Windows HID, Linux udev, PS5 SDK) without modifying the core code.
* **🎮 Advanced Support:** Native support for DualSense Adaptive Triggers, Haptics, and Lightbar.
* **🏎️ Zero-Cost Abstraction:** Heavy use of templates ensures logic is resolved at compile-time for maximum performance.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is structured to strictly separate the **Public API** (Contracts & Templates) from the **Private Implementation** (Logic & Drivers).

## 🛠️ Usage Example (Concept)

1. Initialize with Injection
GamepadCore uses dependency injection to link the Core with your specific platform/engine environment.
```cpp
   // In your Engine's Startup Module (e.g., Unreal Engine)
   void StartupModule()
   {
   // 1. Inject Hardware Driver (Windows, Linux, or Console)
   IPlatformHardwareInfo::SetInstance(new FWindowsHardwareDriver());

   // 2. Initialize Registry with Engine Policy
   // Here we tell the core to use Unreal's TMap and FInputDeviceId
   Registry = std::make_unique<TBasicDeviceRegistry<FUnrealRegistryPolicy>>();
   }
```

2. The Policy (Your Engine Adapter)
   You only need to define how to store the device. The Core handles when to connect it.
```cpp
// Example implementation of a Policy method
EngineIdType AllocEngineDevice(CoreDeviceId CoreId) 
{
    // The Core detected a physical device! Now we tell the engine.
    int32_t NewId = EngineInputSystem::AddDevice();
    return NewId;
}

void DispatchNewGamepad(CoreDeviceId CoreId) 
{
    // Notify the game via Delegate/Event
    OnControllerConnected.Broadcast();
}

void FreeEngineDevice(CoreDeviceId CoreId, EngineIdType EngineId) 
{
    // Cleanup when unplugged
    EngineInputSystem::RemoveDevice(EngineId);
}
```

## 🤝 Integration & Adapters

The `Adapters/` directory contains **reference implementations** and examples. These files are **not** compiled with the core library but serve as a guide on how to bridge `GamepadCore` to your target engine.

* **Unreal Engine:** Examples showing how to map `FInputDeviceId` and `CoreDelegates`.
* **Unity:** Examples of a Native Plugin Interface with C# callbacks.
* **Godot:** GDExtension reference code.

You are encouraged to copy these adapters into your project and modify them to suit your specific architectural needs.
