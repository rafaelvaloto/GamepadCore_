# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all. We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language. With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

* Respecting the purpose of our community, our activities, and our ways of gathering.
* Engaging kindly and honestly with others.
* Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
* Taking responsibility for our actions and contributions.
* Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback.
* Committing to repairing harm when it occurs.
* Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the well-being of our community.

## Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

* **Harassment:** Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
* **Character attacks:** Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
* **Stereotyping or discrimination:** Characterizing anyone's personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
* **Sexualization:** Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
* **Violating confidentiality:** Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information without their permission.
* **Endangerment:** Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.
* **Behaving in other ways that threaten the well-being of our community.**

## Other Restrictions

* **Misleading identity:** Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
* **Failing to credit sources:** Not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute.
* **Promotional materials:** Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside the norms of the community.
* **Irresponsible communication:** Failing to responsibly present content which includes, links or describes any other restricted behaviors.

## Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate. When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly.

To report a possible violation, please contact the Community Moderators at:

* **GitHub Issues:** <a href="https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/Gamepad-Core/issues">https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/Gamepad-Core/issues</a>
* **GitHub Discussions:** <a href="https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/Gamepad-Core/discussions">https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/Gamepad-Core/discussions</a>

Community Moderators take reports of violations seriously and will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. They will investigate all reports, reviewing messages and logs while prioritizing safety and confidentiality.

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

If an investigation finds that this Code of Conduct has been violated, the Community Moderators may use the following enforcement ladder:

1. **Warning:** A private, written warning for a single incident.
2. **Temporarily Limited Activities:** A private warning with a time-limited cooldown period.
3. **Temporary Suspension:** A private warning with conditions for return from suspension.
4. **Permanent Ban:** For repeated violations or a single incident so serious that the community can no longer be kept safe.

This enforcement ladder is intended as a guideline. Community Moderators reserve the right to use their discretion and judgment in the best interests of the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions), and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 3.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/. The enforcement ladder was inspired by the work of Mozilla's code of conduct team.
