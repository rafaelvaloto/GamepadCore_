## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

We take the security of our hardware integrations and C++ core very seriously. If you discover a potential security issue or a vulnerability, please report it privately using one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Private Reporting:** Use the "Report a vulnerability" button under the **Security** tab of this repository. This is the preferred method as it allows for a secure, private discussion.

### What to include in your report:
- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (PoC code if possible).
- The potential impact on users or hardware.

### Our Commitment
After receiving your report, you can expect:
- An initial response within **48 hours** acknowledging the report.
- A timeline for the fix and a public disclosure plan once the patch is ready.
- Credit in our release notes (if you wish) once the patch is live.

## Disclosure Policy
We follow a responsible disclosure policy. We ask that you do not share information about the vulnerability publicly until we have had a reasonable amount of time to provide a fix for our users.
