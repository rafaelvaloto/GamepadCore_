/**
 * @struct FInputContext
 * @brief Represents a structure that captures the current input state of
 * various analog inputs, motion sensors, and button states from a controller or
 * input device.
 *
 * This structure is used to encapsulate the state of inputs such as analog
 * sticks, triggers, motion sensors, and digital button presses for a given
 * frame or context.
 *
 * Members:
 *
 * ### Analog Inputs
 * - LeftAnalog: 2D vector representing the position of the left analog stick.
 * - RightAnalog: 2D vector representing the position of the right analog stick.
 * - LeftTriggerAnalog: Float value representing the analog input of the left
 * trigger.
 * - RightTriggerAnalog: Float value representing the analog input of the right
 * trigger.
 *
 * ### Motion Sensor Data
 * - Gyroscope: 3D vector representing the angular velocity measured by the
 * gyroscope.
 * - Accelerometer: 3D vector representing the linear acceleration detected by
 * the accelerometer.
 * - Gravity: 3D vector representing the gravity vector.
 * - Tilt: 3D vector representing the tilt or orientation of the device.
 *
 * ### Standard Buttons
 * - bCross: Indicates if the "Cross" button is pressed.
 * - bSquared: Indicates if the "Square" button is pressed.
 * - bTriangle: Indicates if the "Triangle" button is pressed.
 * - bCircle: Indicates if the "Circle" button is pressed.
 * - bDpadUp: Indicates if the D-pad "Up" button is pressed.
 * - bDpadDown: Indicates if the D-pad "Down" button is pressed.
 * - bDpadLeft: Indicates if the D-pad "Left" button is pressed.
 * - bDpadRight: Indicates if the D-pad "Right" button is pressed.
 *
 * ### Special Buttons
 * - bLeftTrigger: Indicates if the left trigger button is pressed.
 * - bRightTrigger: Indicates if the right trigger button is pressed.
 * - bLeftShoulder: Indicates if the left shoulder button is pressed.
 * - bRightShoulder: Indicates if the right shoulder button is pressed.
 * - bLeftStick: Indicates if the left stick button is pressed.
 * - bRightStick: Indicates if the right stick button is pressed.
 * - bPSButton: Indicates if the PlayStation/PS button is pressed.
 * - bShare: Indicates if the "Share" button is pressed.
 * - bStart: Indicates if the "Start" button is pressed.
 * - bTouch: Indicates if the touch input is active.
 * - bMute: Indicates if the "Mute" button is pressed.
