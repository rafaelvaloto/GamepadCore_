 *
 * The FAudioConfig class encapsulates various configuration parameters and
 * settings related to an audio system. It provides an interface to manage
 * audio configurations such as sample rate, channel count, and other audio
 * processing properties.
 *
 * This class is intended to be used as part of the audio system to define
 * or modify how audio is processed and output. It acts as a central place
 * for configuring audio-specific parameters.
 *
 * @note Ensure proper initialization of the configuration before using it
 *       with the audio processing pipeline.
