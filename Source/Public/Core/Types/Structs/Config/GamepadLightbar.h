 * @class FGamepadLightbar
 * @brief Represents a light bar with various properties and methods to control
 * its behavior.
 *
 * The FGamepadLightbar class provides an interface for managing and interacting
 * with a programmable light bar. It includes functionality to set and get light
 * patterns, manage brightness, and control other visual effects. This class is
 * typically used in applications where dynamic light effects are required.
 *
 * This class assumes that the underlying hardware is capable of supporting the
 * requested behaviors.
 *
 * Key features include:
 * - Control of brightness settings.
 * - Configuration and retrieval of light patterns.
 * - Management of power state for the light bar.
