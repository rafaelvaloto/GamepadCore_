 * @class FGamepadRumbles
 *
 * @brief The FRumbles class is designed to manage and control rumble feedback
 * for devices such as game controllers.
 *
 * This class provides functionalities to initialize, update, and manipulate
 * rumble effects as part of a feedback mechanism. It is intended to enhance
 * user interaction by simulating vibrations or force feedback based on specific
 * events or triggers.
 *
 * The FRumbles class encapsulates all the necessary operations required to
 * handle the lifecycle of a rumble instance, providing methods for configuring
 * rumble patterns, managing their intensity, and activation state.
