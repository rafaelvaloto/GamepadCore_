	 * enabling or disabling certain features. It ensures the library is prepared
	 * to handle input from a connected DualShock device.
	 *

	 * managing communication with the controller.
	 *
	 * @details The method first verifies the connection status of the HID
	 * device context. If the device is not connected, the operation is aborted.
	 * Otherwise, it delegates the responsibility of handling the output
	 * buffering to the appropriate manager, ensuring proper data flow to the
